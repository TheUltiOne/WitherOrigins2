## About the Origin
Find the description below!

Born in the Terrible Nether Fortress, this Origin has weak bones, but strong abilities. It has a bad unexplained history with the Piglins, but a good one with it's brothers, the blazes and the fellow Wither Skeletons.

+ Spawns in a Nether Fortress
+ Is not hostile with Wither Skeletons/Blazes (unless attacked)
+ Deals Wither effect (x2, 3 seconds, 1 second cooldown)
+ Cannot get Wither Effect
- Deals less knockback due to weak bones
- Gets more kinetic damage
```
